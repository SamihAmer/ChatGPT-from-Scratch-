In this repository, I will be learning about **large language models** (LLMs). Every week, for the next seven weeks, I'll be implementing a relevant component of a LLM. In the end, I will have implemented a fully functional language model! 

Outline: 
1. Tokenization
2. Embeddings
3. Transformers
4. Training the model
5. Sampling from a model
